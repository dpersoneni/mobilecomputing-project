# mobilecomputing-project
University project for mobile development in Java-Android and Javascript-Cordova.

The task was to build a client-side application for a [Discord](https://discord.com/) emulator. This had to be done either for Android and Cross-Platform development.
For the design part I followed [Material Design](https://material.io/design) by Google, while for the logic part I found useful [this](https://github.com/dpersoneni/Java-Projects).

I used a Pixel 3A emulator and the API 29 for the Android part.

The "main" folder if for the Java files, while the "www" one is for the website written for Cordova.
